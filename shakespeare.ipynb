        "# Interpreting Classifier Weights\n",
        "\n",
        "In this experiment, you will train models to distringuish examples of two different genres of Shakespeare's plays: comedies and tragedies. (We'll ignore the histories, sonnets, etc.) Since he died four hundred years ago, Shakespeare has not written any more plays—although scraps of various other works have come to light. We are not, therefore, interested in building models simply to help categorize an unbounded stream of future documents, as we might be in other applications of text classification; rather, we are interested in what a classifier might have to tell us about what we mean by the terms “comedy” and “tragedy”.\n",
        "\n",
        "You will start by copying and running your `createBasicFeatures` function from the experiment with movie reviews. Do the features the classifier focuses on tell you much about comedy and tragedy in general?\n",
        "\n",
        "You will then implement another featurization function `createInterestingFeatures`, which will focus on only those features you think are informative for distinguishing between comedy and tragedy. Accuracy on leave-one-out cross-validation may go up, but it more important to look at the features given the highest weight by the classifier. Interpretability in machine learning, of course, may be harder to define than accuracy—although accuracy at some tasks is hard enoough."

        "With the basic count features, comedies are associated with words tied to lighter, social, and romantic settings. Character names like Helena, Prospero, Leontes, Hermia, and Lysander appear often, along with conversational words such as you, sir, your, me. These suggest the more personal and witty interactions typical of comedies. In contrast, tragedies highlight darker themes and characters: Iago, Othello, Brutus, Lear, Cassio, Desdemona, Caesar, Romeo. These names anchor the tragic plays in betrayal, political conflict, and death. The presence of words like him, his, thy also reflects the more formal, weighty tone of tragedies.\n",
        "\n",
        "The interesting bigram features give even richer insights. In comedies, phrases like “the duke,” “sir toby,” “my love,” “in love,” “if you,” and “I pray” point to themes of love, mistaken identity, noble households, and humor. Specific references such as “sir toby” (from Twelfth Night) or “of syracuse” (from The Comedy of Errors) highlight comedic characters and settings. By contrast, tragedies emphasize expressions of power, death, and fate. Bigrams like “lady macbeth,” “my lord,” “the gods,” “of rome,” and “the moor” strongly evoke Shakespeare’s tragic figures and darker subject matter. Even stage directions like “exeunt scene” appear more often in tragedies, reflecting their heavier dramatic structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the classifiers suggest that comedies are marked by language of love, nobility, and playful dialogue, while tragedies are defined by death, politics, betrayal, and fate. These linguistic patterns align closely with how we understand Shakespeare’s genres, showing that even a simple bag-of-words or bigram model can uncover meaningful thematic distinctions."
